set orto2d(0,250,0,250);
now if u place 0,0 point
u will see the right semi circle..

now 
set orto2d(-250,250,-250,250)

word co ordiante system.
one u have the dimension ready then u put in on the screenn.
for that a transformation is required.

whatever we represent on the screen ..
there is a 1:1 buffer for that..

draw a line..
u need to specify the max value of x,y,z ..
that gives us the bound..

info in teh buffer...
1. depth info 
	certain parts needs to be eliminated or not..

2. color info


2-d transformation

suppose set orto2d(0,250,0,250)

draw a square of 0,0,100,100
now we can use translation 
glTransaltef(tx,ty,tz);
0.0 is the z parameter

w.r.t to origin

change orto2d(-250,250,-250,250)
and observe the results.

stripped lines:
void glLineStipple(GLint factor,Glushort pattern);
glEnable(GL_LINE_STIPPLE)
pattern example is 0xf0f0
sometimes the pattern is not taken from LSB so please check it!!

the pattern is from the right as understood in class.


glBitmap(width height,xo,yo,xofact,yofact,bit shape)

list can start in reverse direction.
when u represent the bitmap as 16 bits..
so u need to have info about unpacking of the info..
that info is stored in some 2 functions..
