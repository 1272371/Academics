The main difference between BTRFS,XFS and EXT4 is that BTRFS uses COWed-Btree to write while other two are overwrite based file systems.
So ,We simulated or implemented the fundamental operations of BTRFS and compared the write time of the file systems.
            BTRFS           XFS,EXT4
Write       1865486ns       5352ns
Read            both are equal

The paper is basically on the architecture of BTRFS . Thus we majorly concenterated on implementation.
