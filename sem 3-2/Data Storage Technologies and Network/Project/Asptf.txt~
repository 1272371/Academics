Shortest positioning time first (SPTF)
SPTF example
• Shortest positioning time first (SPTF)
    - Always pick request with shortest seek time
• Advantages
    - Exploits locality of disk requests
    - Higher throughput
• Disadvantages
    - Starvation
    - Don’t always know what request will be fastest

• Improvement: Aged SPTF
ASPTF  - Aged Shortest Positioning time first
As the name suggests it goes for the operation in which there is least time involved in positioning the head on
the disk target location.


- Give older requests higher priority
- Adjust “effective” seek time with weighting factor:
Teff = Tpos − W · Twait
• Also called Aged Shortest Seek Time First (ASSTF)
