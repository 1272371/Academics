What is pdf factor?

particle filtering algorithm - It is used to track the state of dynamic moving object.(approx) This is the basis of determining position of the vehicle.Because, like Kalman filters, theyâ€™re a great way to track the state of a dynamic system for which you have a Bayesian model. That means that if you have a model of how the system changes in time, possibly in response to inputs, and a model of what observations you should see in particular states,you can use particle filters to track your belief state. 

The map of the seabed is assumed to be known.
They reduce the problem of finding the position of the vehicle in 2-D to improve the performance of the particle filtering algorithm by assuming the depth of the vehicle is given.The 2 parameters are rotation and relative velocity w.r.t to sea bed.

The error or noise is taken in terms of gaussian noise.

Problem statement
Given the kinematic models of two underwater vehicles AUV1 and AUV2, a bathy-
metric map of the area of interest, and measurements of ranges and velocity ob-
tained by the two vehicles with respect to the seabed, estimate the position of AUV1
relative to an inertial frame(start) using: its own measurements, the inter-range measure-
ments between AUV1 and AUV2 and the communicated measurements obtained by
AUV2.


It tries to incorporate the measurements of AUV2 to bring more robustness to the determination of position of AUV1.
