Hadoop DataFlow:

1. First of all there can be multiple mappers and reducers .
2. The complete system works on key/value pairs.
3. There are two main things:
    HDFS
    Mapper - Reduce

4. hdfs is the architecture on which the complete hadoop works:
    it has the following components which are vital to it's functioning
    1. Namenode - This runs on the master node and is responsible for distributing the work(ie. the blocks to different)
                    nodes .
    2. Datanode - This is present on every node .This is what holds the data to be processed.
    3. Job Tracker - Assignment of jobs and responsibility of getting the job done by the slaves is with this job
                    tracker.(failure)
    4. Task Tracker - present on every data node .reports back to job tracker for any kind of requirement.
    5. Secondary Namenode - does the housekeeping business for namenode but remember that this is not the backup of the 
                            namenode.

5. If the namenode fails then the complete task fails.
6. The Mapper reads data in the form of key/value pairs
7. It outputs zero or more key/value pairs
8. Hadoop attempts to ensure that Mappers run on nodes which
   hold their portion of the data locally, to avoid network traffic
9. If the Mapper writes anything out, the output must be in the form
   of key/value pairs
10.After the Map phase is over, all the intermediate values for a
   given intermediate key are combined together into a list
11.This list is given to a Reducer.
    There may be a single Reducer, or multiple Reducers
    – This is specified as part of the job configuration (see later)
    – All values associated with a particular intermediate key are
    guaranteed to go to the same Reducer
    – The intermediate keys, and their value lists, are passed to the
    Reducer in sorted key order
    – This step is known as the ‘shuffle and sort’

12. The Reducer outputs zero or more final key/value pairs
    – These are written to HDFS
    – In practice, the Reducer usually emits a single key/value pair for
    each input key

13. The job is complete here!
