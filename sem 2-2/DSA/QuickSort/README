Just run "./qsortimes.sh 100 10 10 100"
If it fails to execute for permissions, try "chmod a+x qsortimes.sh" first before trying to run it
Or else just run "bash qsortimes.sh 100 10 10 100"

If you are ready to wait longer and see statistically reliable results,
then repeat the experiment with 100000 repetitions for sizes 100 to 1000 with step 100:
"./qsortimes 100000 100 100 1000"
It will give a warning and you will have to confirm with a "Y" before continuing.

Examine the pdfs generated at the end. histogram4n*.pdf files give you an idea of how the average
and best cases span in relation to the worse cases. runtime.pdf is the actual behavior of the
runtimes with increasing sizes.
